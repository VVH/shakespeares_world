<h1>General Guidelines</h1>

<h2>Original Spelling</h2>

<p>It’s important to preserve original spelling (including u/v and i/j, and ff for F), punctuation, capitalization, lineation, and indentation are maintained.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>u/v</dt>
    <dd><img class="img-responsive" src="images/guide/unfortunate.jpg"></dd>
    <dd>transcribed as “vnfortunate”</dd>

    <dt>i/j</dt>
    <dd><img class="img-responsive" src="images/guide/judgement.jpg"></dd>
    <dd>transcribed as “Iudgment”</dd>

    <dt>ff/F</dt>
    <dd><img class="img-responsive" src="images/guide/ffrance.png"></dd>
    <dd>transcribed as “ffrance:”</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Abbreviations and Expansions</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Abbreviated words are expanded or written out
    <dd><img class="img-responsive" src="images/guide/portsmouth.jpg"></dd>
    <dd>expanded to “Portsmouth”</dd>

    <dt>Exceptions of words that are not expanded include forms of address (Mr, Mrs, <img src="images/guide/mr.jpg"><img src="images/guide/mrs.jpg">)  and symbols for money [l for pound, s for shilling, d for pence.</dt>
    <dd>Example: <img src="images/guide/xij.png"> transcribed as xij.s xd</dd>
</dt>

<p>Shakespeare’s World’s transcription menu also has shortcut buttons for commonly-seen abbreviations, which save time by automatically entering the expanded text.</p>

<h2>Common brevigraphs</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>The “special p” <img src="images/guide/p.jpg"> is transcribed as per, par, pro, or pre, depending on the context.</dt>
    <dd>Example: <img src="images/guide/personally.jpg"> is expanded as “personallie”</dd>

    <dt>The “er graph” <img src="images/guide/er.jpg"> is a flourishing hook shaped stroke that goes up and over the preceding letter (also could be used for ar/or/re and other combinations).</dt>
    <dd>Example: <img src="images/guide/nevertheless.jpg"> is expanded as “neuerthelesse”</dd>

    <dt>The “es” graph <img src="images/guide/es.png"> is a looped stroke curving downwards after the last letter of a word; it looks like the italic e sliding off the page.</dt>

    <dt>A horizontal line drawn over a letter or letters (especially m or n), also called a tilde, tittle or macron usually indicates a contraction of that letter.
