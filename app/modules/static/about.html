        <h1>About Shakespeare’s World</h1>

        <p>Shakespeare’s World is a collaboration between the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. and Zooniverse.org at Oxford University. In this project we’re inviting you to work with images of manuscript documents created in and around Shakespeare’s lifetime, 1564–1616.</p>

        <p>2016 marks the 400th anniversary of his death, and it’s an opportune time to reconsider the Bard himself, and his contemporaries. What was it like to live, work or raise a family in Elizabethan England? What did people eat, what did they wear, what did they do for fun? What did they read and how did they travel?</p>

        <p>Find out all of this and more by transcribing family papers, ‘receipt’ (recipe) books, miscellanies, legal and literary documents. Whatever your interest, there is something here for you!</p>
